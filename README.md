# @EtherTyper's Unreal Mods

After you've signed the Unreal Engine EULA, clause 1b. allows us to work together on Unreal Engine and mods! To gain permissions to read and contribute to my modding masterpieces, just ask at this repo's [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/EtherTyper/Signup). If you've set your membership in the Epic Games GitHub organization to public, I can see that you're an Unreal Engine licensee, and I'll invite you to my private repository, located [here](https://github.com/EtherTyper/UnrealEngine). Please ask if you want a part!
